						<h1>
							About Us
						</h1>
						<p>
							<b>GVC Advisory Services Ltd.</b> assists its clients by providing a thorough, independent evaluation and analysis of current operations, operating results, strategic planning, and the development of effective growth strategies. Our advisory services are designed to provide improvements in cash flows, liquidity, and return on capital.
						</p>
						<p>
							<br><br>Our mission statement is to maximize our clients operational efficiencies and in many cases to prepare them for funding from the capital markets. <b>GVC Advisory Services Ltd.</b> is composed of two executives possessing over 40 years of relevant business, advisory and banking experience.
						</p>
						<div class="image main"><img src="images/+buildings.jpg" alt="" /></div>
						<p>
							<br>The principals, Melvin Gilbert and Ernie Vicentina, have worked in start-up, turnaround, small, medium and large company environments and have managed large and small staffs. The two collectively possess a very strong educational and practical background in finance and accounting, and have extensive experience in operations, strategic planning, auditing, consulting, and raising capital through debt, equity, and mezzanine markets.
						</p>
						<p>
							<br><br>As a financial consulting firm headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, <b>GVC Advisory Services Ltd.</b> handles all aspects of a client transaction, from advisor or author of the client's business plan, financial pro-formas, and recommending competent legal advisors through to a successful closing. Part of the process is to participate in the audit and due diligence portion of the funding process.
						</p>
						<div class="image main"><img src="images/+hands.jpg" alt="" /></div>
						<p>
							<br><br>This has provided <b>GVC Advisory Services Ltd.</b> with unusual insight into lender requirements and an understanding of the factors that make an organization viable, profitable, and "bankable." With recent disclosures of accounting malfeasance at some large U.S. companies, this independent ability to accurately analyze a client's viability is invaluable.
