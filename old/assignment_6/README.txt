Note: the modify options on the Product Detail page (the size, quantity, etc.) where the page changes according to the userâ€™s selection is only implemented on the Famous Original detail page (according to 6a instructions). On this page, when a user chooses a glaze, the images update to reflect the choice of glaze on the Famous Original detail page.

Extra Work:

Added a wishlist function on the Famous Original Cinnamon Roll, Walnut, and Gluten-Free Product Detail pages. As you click, it adds an item to the wishlist and updates the wishlist counter on the detail page (will say "Add to Wishlist (1)" for example). You will be able to find the full wishlist on the bottom of the shopping cart page.

Added a carousel on the Famous Original Cinnamon Roll Product Detail page (and other detail pages for walnut and gluten-free) that shows the other flavors available. The carousel is able to scroll left and right.
